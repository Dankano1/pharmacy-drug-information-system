Create `src/drug_info.py`:

```python
class Drug:
    def __init__(self, name, indication, dose, contraindications):
        self.name = name
        self.indication = indication
        self.dose = dose
        self.contraindications = contraindications

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Drug: {self.name}")
        print(f"Indication: {self.indication}")
        print(f"Dose: {self.dose}")
        print("Contraindications:")
        for item in self.contraindications:
            print(f"- {item}")
